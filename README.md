# **Freight Wagon Unloading Information Dashboard**

*(Excel-based analytics for Iran Railway Network)*

## **Overview**

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of **wagon unloading operations** across the Iranian railway network. It summarizes unloading queue status, number of unloaded wagons, station performance, and the share of commodities unloaded in key cities. Through filters for year, season, month, cargo type, and destination station, users can analyze temporal trends and operational efficiency across the network.

## **1. Unloading Queue Information (Top-Left Bar Chart)**

This multi-category bar chart shows monthly statistics for two years (1398–1399), broken down by:

* **Average waiting wagons** (yellow)
* **Average wagons under unloading** (green)
* **Average unloaded wagons** (blue)
* **Average total of waiting + under unloading** (red)

The chart reveals:

* Seasonal peaks in unloading activity
* Congestion periods when waiting wagons exceed unloading capacity
* Months where operational efficiency improved or declined

This visualization helps assess **terminal performance** and identify bottlenecks at unloading facilities.

---

## **2. Percentage of Wagon Status at Destination Stations (Top-Center Donut Chart)**

A donut chart summarizing the proportion of wagons that are:

* **Unloaded** (blue – 27%)
* **Under unloading** (orange – 36%)
* **Waiting for unloading** (grey – 37%)

This metric provides a high-level snapshot of **terminal congestion** and **loading/unloading workflow balance**.

---

## **3. Filter Panel (Top-Right)**

Users can interactively filter data by:

* **Year:** 1398, 1399
* **Season:** Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter
* **Month:** Farvardin to Esfand
* **Cargo Type:** Iron Ore, Coal, Limestone, Pellet, Gypsum, etc.
* **Destination Station:** All unloading terminals (e.g., Isfahan, Tehran, Bandar Abbas, etc.)

This enables granular analysis of specific operations, mines, and periods.

---

## **4. Daily Unloading Counts (Middle-Left Line Chart)**

A detailed time-series chart displaying the **daily number of unloaded wagons** across two full years.

Key insights:

* Sharp spikes highlight high-volume or congestion days.
* Seasonal fluctuations are visible (e.g., peak unloads in late summer and fall).
* Operational consistency and volatility can be assessed using this long-range trend.

This view helps analysts evaluate **daily workload**, **capacity utilization**, and **network stability**.

## **5. Percentage of Unloaded Freight by City (Bottom-Right Bar Chart)**

This horizontal stacked bar chart shows the **commodity mix** for major destination cities.
For each city, the chart displays:

* **Iron Ore**
* **Iron Ore Powder**
* **Coal**
* **Gypsum**, etc.

For each city, the chart also includes:

* **Number of unloaded wagons**
* **Number of wagons under unloading**
* **Number of waiting wagons**

This visualization provides:

* A clear picture of **what commodities each city receives**
* Which cities experience **more congestion**
* Comparison of operational efficiency among terminals

---

## **6. Key Insights**

* **Unloading queues fluctuate significantly**, with some months showing very high waiting times.
* **Only 27% of wagons reach the completed unloading stage**, while **37% remain in the waiting queue**, indicating congestion.
* Daily unloading volumes reveal **variation and stress periods**, useful for resource planning.
* Major destination cities show **distinct commodity profiles**, reflecting industrial demand patterns.

## **Summary**

> This unloading dashboard visualizes the operational performance of freight wagon handling across the Iranian railway network. It includes queue statistics, daily unloading activity, commodity composition at destination cities, and real-time status proportions for unloaded, under-unloading, and waiting wagons. With filters for time, commodity type, and destination stations, the dashboard enables detailed analysis of congestion, operational efficiency, and commodity flows. It supports managers and analysts in monitoring terminal performance and optimizing freight movement across the network.
